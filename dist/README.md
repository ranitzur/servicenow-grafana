# Setup Instructions

For your ServiceNow instance to work with our Grafana plugin, you must first install our [Grafana Plugin](https://github.com/R2DToo/Grafana-Plugin-ServiceNow.git) application on your ServiceNow instance.

## Step 1: Install application in ServiceNow Instance

### Search for and click on "studio" in the application navigator

![Search for Studio](https://github.com/optimizca/servicenow-grafana/raw/main/readme_images/search_studio.png)

### Click on the "Import From Source Control" button

![Import From Source Control Button](https://github.com/optimizca/servicenow-grafana/raw/main/readme_images/sourcecontrol_button.png)

### Enter import details as shown below

- URL: https://github.com/R2DToo/Grafana-Plugin-ServiceNow.git
- Branch: master
- Credentials: Any GitHub account will work. (Even though the repo is public, ServiceNow requires credentials regardless of visibility)

![Import Details](https://github.com/optimizca/servicenow-grafana/raw/main/readme_images/import_details.png)

### Create a new user in ServiceNow for Grafana to connect with

**_The new user's Time zone MUST be set to "GMT" and they need the role of "admin"._**

## Step 2: Install Grafana Plugin

### Quick Install:

Option based scripts written for each operating system give you the option to install Grafana + our plugin or just our plugin in your existing Grafana. [Click here for Quick Install Setup](https://github.com/optimizca/servicenow-grafana/tree/main/scripts)

### Manual Install:

Download or clone the repository and move the unziped folder into your Grafana plugins folder, then restart Grafana.

## Step 3: Grafana Datasource Configuration

1. Open Grafana Configuration => Data Sources
2. Click on the "Add data source" Button
3. Search for and add our "servicenow-optimiz-plugin"
4. Configure the data source based on fields below. Required fields are marked with a ‚ùó

- Logo URL: URL to an image you wish to use as logo. (Default value is a ServiceNow Logo)
- API Path: Path to our application's API's in your ServiceNow instance. (Please do not change the default value unless you are a developer or understand the implications)
- Cache Timeout: Choose length of time to cache each query
- ‚ùó URL: The URL to your ServiceNow instance. (For convenience the default value is mostly filled in. Just replace <instance_name> with your own)
- ‚ùó Access: Leave this value as Server (default)
- ‚ùó Basic Auth: Set this to true
- ‚ùó With Credentials: Set this to true
- ‚ùó User: Enter the ServiceNow username we created earlier in Step 1
- ‚ùó Password: Enter the ServiceNow user's password we created earlier in Step 1

5. Click on the "Save & Test" Button. If you get the message "Data source connection is successful" then the plugin is ready to use!

## Step 4: Import Our Grafana Dashboards

# FAQ

### How do I fix the "Panel plugin not found: x" error?

You are seeing this because the panel plugin we used in the dashboard is not installed on your instance of Grafana.

- Take note of the panel plugin name displayed in the error (plugin names are formated like (author)-(pluginName)-(pluginType))
  ![Missing Plugin Error](https://github.com/optimizca/servicenow-grafana/raw/main/readme_images/missing_plugin_error.png)
- Navigate to Grafana Configuration => Plugins
- Search for the plugin in the error (Search based on the middle word the plugin displayed in the error)
  ![Search Missing Plugin](https://github.com/optimizca/servicenow-grafana/raw/main/readme_images/search_for_plugin.png)
- Click into the plugin (You will know its the correct one based off the authors name)
- Click the Install Button
  ![Install Plugin Button](https://github.com/optimizca/servicenow-grafana/raw/main/readme_images/install_plugin.png)

### Why am I getting a Bad Gateway error on my panels?

The default timeout for requests made by Grafana in 30 seconds. If your request takes longer than 30 seconds you will see this error.

There are a few possible fixes for this error. Please try each fix as they all work differently and will depend on your needs of the data.

- If you are looking for a subset of data rather than the entire table, try adding some filters to the Sysparam Query
- If displaying every field on the record is not a necessity, try specifying which fields you would like to see in the Table Columns option
- If your familiar with pagination we also have this as an option to reduce the amount of records returned in each query. To use pagination, in the Limit option enter in the number of records to return per request(default is 9999). Then increment the Page option by 1 each time you wish to advance pages(default starts at 0)
- The last fix here is one I do not recommend but is still an option. In the data source configuration page there is an option called Timeout, there you can specify your desired request timeout in seconds(default is 30). I do not reccomend this fix as it will likely lead you to the error below this one, use at your own risk.

### How do I fix the error "String object would exceed maximum permitted size of 33554432"?

This happens when the amount of data being returned from a query is greater than 32MB.

- To fix this issue, try the steps in the above question as both are fixed in nearly the same way.

### How do I fix the error Bad Request "Requested URI does not represent any resource"?

We do not currently know what causes this issue as it happens on some instances but not others. If you have more information, please let us know :)

- Inside of your ServiceNow instance, search for and click on "Scripted REST APIs"
  ![Search for Scripted REST APIs](https://github.com/optimizca/servicenow-grafana/raw/main/readme_images/search_rest_apis.png)
- Search the Name field for "Grafana API" and open the record
  ![Search name Grafana API](https://github.com/optimizca/servicenow-grafana/raw/main/readme_images/search_grafana_api.png)
- Remove the "Scripted REST External Default" ACL from the list and save the record
  ![ACL Option](https://github.com/optimizca/servicenow-grafana/raw/main/readme_images/acl_fix1.png)
  ![Removing ACL from list](https://github.com/optimizca/servicenow-grafana/raw/main/readme_images/acl_fix2.png)
- In the same record, add the "Scripted REST External Default" ACL back into the list and save the record again
  ![Add ACL back into list](https://github.com/optimizca/servicenow-grafana/raw/main/readme_images/acl_fix3.png)

### Why do the select boxes show "No options found"?

Currently you will see this on nearly every select box, but we plan to improve/fix this in a future update.

- To get past the "No options found" message, simply enter a space or start typing your desired option and the options will be updated to show actual values

# Query Editor Options
