## [1.2.2] - In Development

- Bug fix for sysparam query field after Grafana V8.3 update

## [1.2.1] - 2021-11-24

- New Tag Filtering options have been added to Alert queries. These rely on TBAC(Tag Based Alert Clustering Engine) and will search through relevent alert record's additional_info fields for keys with the 'tbac-' prefix and give you options to filter based on these key-value pairs.
- New variables have also been added to allow templating of these tag filters. Find more information on how to set them up on our [Variables Wiki](https://github.com/optimizca/servicenow-grafana/wiki/Variables).
- Updated anomaly metrics query to accept multiple cis, multiple metrics, and you can now use \* as a metric to get all metrics
- Updated topology drilldown links to use sys_id instead of name for more reliable results
- Added new column for queries on the Alerts table. It is called tbac_data and holds json key-value pairs parsed out of the Additional Info field. Additional Info keys must be prefixed with tbac- to be included in new column
